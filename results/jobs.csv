* Git (or other CM tools)
* Agile development
* CI/CD or development pipelines

  

A day in the life  

In this role, you will collaborate with Product Teams to design solutions that make efficient use of resources and technologies. You will bring a detail\\-oriented approach and excellent problem\\-solving abilities, backed by a deep understanding of distributed system design and delivery. Your contributions will leverage cross\\-functional business and technical skills, assessing and managing risks, measuring and reporting on progress, anticipating and resolving bottlenecks, providing escalation management, making tradeoffs, and balancing business needs with technical constraints.  

  

You will drive engineering deliverables through influence rather than authority, manage repair requests in a high\\-volume environment, and respond to high\\-severity events.
